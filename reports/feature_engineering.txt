Steps for feature engineering

1. Group by Run ID, Process Step & Step ID and aggregate Sensor Value data (for both incoming and run). Also agg Start and End Times by the mean
2. LEFT JOIN run, incoming ON [Run ID, Process Step & Step ID]
3. Concat aggregated dataframes
4. One hot encode Run ID, Process Step and Step ID fields
5. Calculate Duration as taking End - Start Time
6. LEFT JOIN the metrology data ON Run ID

Dataset ready.


Columns for model input:

1. Aggregated sensor data
2. Process info
